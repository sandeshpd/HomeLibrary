Home Library platform built with modern web technologies (React/Go/gin-gonic/MongoDB)

## About
This project is a full-stack simulation of a modern Book Store Platform, designed to showcase how different technologies can be combined to deliver a scalable, AI-powered application.

The system brings together a React-based frontend for an engaging user experience, a Go-based backend for high-performance API services that runs on the gin (gin-gonic) web framework.

It also demonstrates how MongoDB can serve as a reliable, scalable database solution for managing books and more.
